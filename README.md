#  SmartRentCalculator : Creating a Machine Learning-Based Tool for Predicting Rental Prices and Identifying Affordable Housing Options


In this SmartRentCalculator project, I aimed to tackle the challenges that international students like myself face when searching for affordable and suitable off-campus housing while planning to study at Constructor University in Bremen, My primary focus was on creating a comprehensive and accurate dataset through web scraping techniques from the popular German rental website, eBay Kleinanzeigen.The main goal of my project was to develop a web-based tool Which i called SmartRentCalculator. I implemented machine learning algorithms to predict rental prices based on various features of a rental property, including location, number of bedrooms, square footage, and more. Additionally, I employed clustering and machine learning techniques to identify clusters of affordable rental properties based on the user’s desired location and preferences.
The target users of the SmartRentCalculator are international students, including myself, who may not be familiar with the local rental market in Germany and require off-campus accommodations. My idea is that i designed the tool to be accessible through the Constructor University website, making it convenient for students to find affordable housing options. However, I also recognized that local students could benefit from the tool when seeking affordable housing alternatives.To achieve the objectives of my project, I had to employ web scraping techniques to extract data from eBay Kleinanzeigen. This process allowed me to compile a comprehensive and accurate dataset that would serve as the foundation for the SmartRentCalculator. I meticulously collected data on rental properties in Bremen, ensuring the dataset’s quality and representativeness.Once I obtained the dataset, I embarked on a full cycle of data mining processes. I had to clean the data, addressing issues such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Data integration techniques were then applied to consolidate information from multiple sources, ensuring the dataset’s compatibility and consistency.Next, I focused on data transformation,

leveraging tools such as Python, Scikit-learn, and Pandas to implement and apply various data mining methods. Using advanced supervised machine learning techniques, I built models capable of predicting rental prices accurately. Evaluating and comparing different algorithms allowed me to select the most suitable ones based on factors like scalability, eﬀiciency, and performance in practical scenarios.
Throughout the project, I continually refined the SmartRentCalculator to optimize its usability and effectiveness. In addition to predicting rental prices, I incorporated natural language processing (NLP) techniques to enhance the tool’s functionality. By allowing users to describe specific details of their desired rental property, beyond standard features like bedrooms and square footage, I aimed to provide a more personalized and accurate housing recommendation system.The SmartRentCal- culator project yielded significant outcomes. I successfully created a machine learning-based tool that predicts rental prices and identifies affordable housing options. Furthermore, the dataset I compiled comprised over 10,000 entries, ensuring its robustness and reliability. By incorporating NLP techniques, I provided users with a more comprehensive and precise housing search experi- ence.And it is important to mention that this model is too good to be true because it’s accuracy rate is almost hundred percent which raises more questions.Lastly let me say through this project, I have gained practical experience in performing a full cycle of data mining and analysis, and have hope to contributed to the well-being of the international student community at Constructor University by providing an accessible and user-friendly housing solution.
